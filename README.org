* PokÉlm

A simple Pokédex built with Elm.

** About the language

Elm is a purely functional language that compiles to JavaScript.
The language was created in 2012 by Evan Czaplicki and it advertises "no runtime exceptions".


** Getting started 

This project was a suggestion from a [[https://github.com/KalilCazes][friend of mine]]. I'll try to link as much as possible the materials that helped me do this project.
I hope that this code will be useful for someone.
